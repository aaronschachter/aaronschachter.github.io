I've been coding in Javascript and Objective C most recently ([Github](http://github.com/aaronschachter) profile), but also have years of experience working with PHP and MySQL ([Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/aaronschachter) profile).


## Projects

Here are a few projects that I've led development on which I'm proud to share:

### Gambit

Gambit is a chatbot that powers signup and completion of DoSomething.org volunteer campaigns over SMS.

### DoSomething: Take Action on the News
* [Source](http://github.com/dosomething/letsdothis-ios) - *Objective C, React Native*
* [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosomething-take-action-on/id998995766?ls=1&mt=8)

The DoSomething mobile app delivers news content, along with related DoSomething.org volunteer campaigns to complete and make a difference. I was the lead engineer for the iOS app.

### SMART Recovery: Cost Benefit Analysis

I developed the [Smart Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/) app as my 1-month volunteer sabbatical at DoSomething.org.
